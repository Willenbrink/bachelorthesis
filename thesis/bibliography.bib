Unification theory abstracts from the specific applications of this process: it provides formal definitions for important notions like instantiation, most general unifier, etc., investigates properties of these notions, and provides and analyzes unification algorithms that can be used in different contexts. In this intro­ductory section, we will first present the concept of unification in an informal way, then make some historical remarks on where unification was originally introduced, and finally explain our approach to writing this chapter.},

Experiments were conducted on large sets of terms to determine how the properties of the terms affect the performance of the two indexing methods. Results of the experiments are presented.},

	abstract = {We present a higher-order term indexing strategy based on substitution trees for simply typed lambda-terms. There are mainly two problems in adapting first-order indexing techniques. First, many operations used in building an efficient term index and retrieving a set of candidate terms from a large collection are undecidable in general for higher-order terms. Second, the scoping of variables and binders in the higher-order case presents challenges.
            The approach taken in this article is to reduce the problem to indexing linear higher-order patterns, a decidable fragment of higher-order terms, and delay solving terms outside of this fragment. We present insertion of terms into the index based on computing the most specific linear generalization of two linear higher-order patterns, and retrieval based on matching two linear higher-order patterns. Our theoretical framework maintains that terms are in βη-normal form, thereby eliminating the need to renormalize and raise terms during insertion and retrieval. Finally, we prove correctness of our presented algorithms. This indexing structure is implemented as part of the Twelf system to speed up the execution of the tabled higher-logic programming interpreter.},
