	abstract = {Unification is a fundamental process upon which many methods for automated de­duction are based. Unification theory abstracts from the specific applications of this process: it provides formal definitions for important notions like instantiation, most general unifier, etc., investigates properties of these notions, and provides and analyzes unification algorithms that can be used in different contexts. In this intro­ductory section, we will first present the concept of unification in an informal way, then make some historical remarks on where unification was originally introduced, and finally explain our approach to writing this chapter.},

	abstract = {In ordinary lambda calculus the occurrences of a bound variable are made recognizable by the use of one and the same (otherwise irrelevant) name at all occurrences. This convention is known to cause considerable trouble in cases of substitution. In the present paper a different notational system is developed, where occurrences of variables are indicated by integers giving the “distance” to the binding il instead of a name attached to that 1. The system is claimed to be efficient for automatic formula manipulation as well aa for metdingual discussion. As an example the most essential part of a proof of the Church-Rosser theorem is presented in this namefree calculus.},
