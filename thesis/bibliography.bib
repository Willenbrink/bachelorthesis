In this intro­ductory section, we will first present the concept of unification in an informal way, then make some historical remarks on where unification was originally introduced, and finally explain our approach to writing this chapter.},

This convention is known to cause considerable trouble in cases of substitution. In the present paper a different notational system is developed, where occurrences of variables are indicated by integers giving the “distance” to the binding il instead of a name attached to that 1. The system is claimed to be efficient for automatic formula manipulation as well aa for metdingual discussion. As an example the most essential part of a proof of the Church-Rosser theorem is presented in this namefree calculus.},

	abstract = {One of the reasons that forward search methods, like resolution, are eﬃcient in practice is their ability to utilize many optimization techniques. One such technique is subsumption and one way of utilizing subsumption eﬃciently is by indexing terms using substitution trees. In this paper we describe an attempt to extend such indexes for the use of higher-order resolution theorem provers. Our attempt tries to handle two diﬃculties which arise when extending the indexes to higher-order. The ﬁrst diﬃculty is the need for higher-order anti-uniﬁcation. The second diﬃculty is the closure of clauses under associativity and commutativity. We present some techniques which attempt to solve these two problems.},

	abstract = {We present a higher-order term indexing strategy based on substitution trees for simply typed lambda-terms. There are mainly two problems in adapting first-order indexing techniques. First, many operations used in building an efficient term index and retrieving a set of candidate terms from a large collection are undecidable in general for higher-order terms. Second, the scoping of variables and binders in the higher-order case presents challenges.
            The approach taken in this article is to reduce the problem to indexing linear higher-order patterns, a decidable fragment of higher-order terms, and delay solving terms outside of this fragment. We present insertion of terms into the index based on computing the most specific linear generalization of two linear higher-order patterns, and retrieval based on matching two linear higher-order patterns. Our theoretical framework maintains that terms are in βη-normal form, thereby eliminating the need to renormalize and raise terms during insertion and retrieval. Finally, we prove correctness of our presented algorithms. This indexing structure is implemented as part of the Twelf system to speed up the execution of the tabled higher-logic programming interpreter.},
