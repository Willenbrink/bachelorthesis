I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Dr. Nipkow for giving me the opportunity to write my thesis at his chair. Moreover, I want to thank my advisor Kevin Kappelmann for generously taking his time to answer my questions, providing valuable feedback on my implementation and assisting me in familiarising myself with Isabelle. Furthermore, none of this would have been possible without the unconditional support and trust of my brother, Matthias, and my parents, Kirsten und Wolfgang. Thank you for believing in me.
