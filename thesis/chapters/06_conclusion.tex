\section{Related Work}
\todo{Namen, nicht nur Referenz}
Our work was inspired by the work of \cite{noauthor_path-indexing_nodate} that introduced path indexing as an alternative to discrimination trees.


and \cite{mccune_experiments_1992}

\section{Future Work}
Test with real world application
Test with different generators
Benchmarks with less noise (larger size? Other environment?)
Implement Substitution Trees, possibly better in every respect?
