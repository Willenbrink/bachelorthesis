\chapter{Evaluation}
Is PI better than DT? Theory and randomly tested

\section{Expectations}
Theoretical analysis, ref to comparison paper.
In what cases is what approach superior?
Prefix sharing

\section{Approach}
Randomly generated. Generation difficult, details on generator
Focus on variable appearance as prefix sharing is even more difficult to reproduce

\section{Comparison of PITT and DT}

\subsection{Variants}
PI a bit better

\subsection{Instances}
PI significantly better

\subsection{Generalisations}
DT significantly better

\subsection{Unifiables}
PI significantly better

\subsection{Maintenance Operations}
PITT ca equal at insert, sig better at delete

\subsection{Performance over Variable Frequency}
At what point is break-even.
Move perhaps as subsubsection into every query above.

\subsection{Performance over Size}
PITT scales better perhaps?

\section{Comparison of PITT and PI}
PITT significantly better
\subsection{Insert}
\subsection{Delete}

\section{Recommendation}
PI never
PITT whenever: exact lookup, many vars, many unifs, many instances
DN whenever, few vars, many gens

\section{Shortcomings}
Generators do not represent real applications
Tests are noisy due to ?. PolyML?
